# Updating the Appliance

To ensure that your Appliance has the latest functionality, security, and bug fixes, Auth0 requires you to perform regular updates. While the Auth0 engineering team releases updates on a monthly basis, you should plan updates on a monthly, bi-monthly, and quarterly basis. You should not exceed **90 days** without updating the Appliance.
